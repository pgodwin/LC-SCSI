# Fritzing Breadboard Layout

Quick layout in Fritzing so I could plan out how I was going to hook things up...

## Fritzing Notes
I've decided Fritzing isn't for me. It's slow, buggy, and lacks simple features.

If these features exist I can't find them:
 * naming a net/bus. 
 * you can name wires, but they don't show up in between breadboard and schematic mode
 * swapping parts
 * dragging to a breadboard - if I drag from a component to the breadboard it won't attach to the breadboard. Dragging from the breadboard to the component does work.
